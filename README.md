# Final: Practical Introduction to Computer Security and Policy

This project demonstrates a privacy feature for a tech support helpline for older adults that struggle with technology. The written code ensures that the caller preserves their personal privacy by asking them for consent to record the call using an informative approach. The implementation has been made using a registered Twilio phone number. The code can be executed from the Twilio console but is also uploaded in this repository. The code is split into 2 files. When the caller calls the registered phone number, the security_transcribe file runs. After the execution of its code, the security_respond function gets called. If the caller gives permission to record the call, the recording can be retrieved from the Twilio database.
